 So first of all I would like to say thank you so much for all the amazing guidance that you gave me in such a short period of time. 
In the very first month I missed some classes and I regret for that but when I started attending it regularly I got to know it's pretty different it's not like what I actually thought.
My thinking was that the classes would be boring as well as we couldn't get as much knowledge as we could get in offline coachings but I was totally wrong like actually I have zero interest in science and that was my one of the biggest weakness but I'm so happy that now I'm improving a lot in it and in maths I had interest but don't practice it as much but ur classes,assignments and many more made it a daily routine to practicw maths. </p>
<p And during this pandemic time we need somebody who could teach us in online classes and we can understand it and I feel super lucky and blessed that u came up with this project
And I'm pretty sure this project would help me to build up my future.</p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-size:30px; font-family:vardana">Thanks a ton for all your guidance. </p>
