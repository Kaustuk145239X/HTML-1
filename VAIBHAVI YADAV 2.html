<h2>                <U>ABOUT ME</U>                                        <U>MY EXPERIENCE</U></H2>
   I think I am little bit creative as my drawing skills     <div class="vl"><pre><font size="5",face="vardana"><b>    I am very delighted to be a student of this project.
   It seems to be incredible; from the day of joining the classes, not even a single class felt boring, every class gives us excitement and we are always ready for learning something new.
   During the ongoing pandemic when there was no means of study, Project Srijan became the ray of hope.
   Sir and Ma'am helped us to enhance our overall performance; either science or maths, both have improved very much. Aviral Sir as well as Rishika Ma'am teach very nicely and made the concepts very clear. Sir's way of teaching is exemplary which turned all the difficult topics into a piece of cake.
   A day without class feels to be useless. Be it a class till 10 pm or classes at 7 in the morning. I am always eager to join the classes.
   At last I would like to say that these 6 months cannot be expressed in words and would surely love to continue to enjoy and learn with our amazing teachers. </p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-size:30px; font-family:vardana">Thanks a ton for all your guidance.   </pre></div>
