 My experience with this Project Srijan</br>
 
 Honorable Aviral Bhaiya and Rishika Didi,</br>
 I was happy about our school seniors going to start with some classes</br>.
 I started loving the classes from the Day 1.I found out that I started studying more and my Maths is becoming better than before(My maths was weak). As I started giving my Maths tests I got few marks and I was upset with those marks and then bhaiya said to us "If you do your test without cheating you will get good and feel happy" and when I did my last Maths test,I got few marks but still I was happy that I did it and now I know I can do it more better...</br>
 I haven't memories from starting but I will make for sure.</br>
 Sir helped us to utilise our time properly in this Covid suitations</br>
 My Maths and Science is becoming better and better day by day and it's all credit goes to Aviral Bhaiya and Rishika Didi</br>
 In future I will definitely remember about Project Srijan,Aviral Bhaiya and Rishika Didi </br>
 
 Thank you so much.....!
