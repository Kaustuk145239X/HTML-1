 It was a day when I joined the Project Srijan first time.<br>
 I was very excited to join the first class.<br>
 In my first class I really enjoyed that class and I thought that to join project Srijan was my right decision.<br>
 I spend four months with this and journey of this four months was full of excitement,joy,happiness and competition.<br>
 In these four months he taught us maths ,science and computer too from last one month and each and every concepts was quite clear to me.<br>
 He helped us learn so much I really appreciate his kindness and patience.<br>
 When I or anyone couldn't understand something he took the extra time to understand that topic clear.<br>
 He was not only our teacher, he was our friend and guide us to walk on right path.<br>
 I always be very greatful for your support.<br>
 Thanks for making me what I am today.
